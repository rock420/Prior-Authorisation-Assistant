He has completed a comprehensive course of conservative treatment including:\n\n1. Physical Therapy: 12 sessions over 6 weeks (09/10/2024 - 10/25/2024)\n2. NSAIDs: Naproxen 500mg BID x 6 weeks\n3. Muscle Relaxants: Cyclobenzaprine 10mg QHS x 6 weeks\n\nDespite this treatment, the patient has developed new and concerning symptoms:\n- Radiating pain from lumbar spine to left lower extremity\n- Numbness in L5 dermatomal distribution\n- Motor weakness (EHL 4/5)\n- Positive straight leg raise test\n\nMEDICAL NECESSITY:\nMRI is medically necessary to:\n1. Evaluate for lumbar disc herniation causing nerve root compression\n2. Rule out other structural pathology (spinal stenosis, tumor, infection)\n3. Guide treatment planning (conservative vs. interventional vs. surgical)\n\nThe patient meets criteria for imaging based on:\n- Failed conservative treatment > 6 weeks\n- New neurological deficits\n- Progressive symptoms despite treatment\n\nPlease contact our office with any questions.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. Emily Davis, MD\nNorthwest Primary Care\nNPI: 5566778899\nPhone: 206-555-4000"

Over the past 2 weeks, symptoms have gradually returned:\n- Left leg pain now 6/10 (was 3/10 at best)\n- Numbness in left foot persists\n- Back pain 5/10\n- Difficulty with prolonged standing and walking\n\nOBJECTIVE:\n- Gait: Mildly antalgic\n- SLR: Positive left at 50 degrees (improved from 40)\n- Strength: Left EHL 4/5\n- Sensation: Decreased left L5 dermatome\n\nASSESSMENT:\nL4-L5 disc herniation with recurrent left L5 radiculopathy. Partial response to epidural injection with symptom recurrence.\n\nMEDICAL NECESSITY FOR REPEAT MRI:\nClinical change documented - patient had significant initial response to epidural injection (60% improvement) followed by symptom recurrence. This clinical trajectory suggests possible interval change in disc pathology. Repeat MRI is medically necessary to:\n1. Evaluate for disc re-herniation or progression\n2. Assess for new pathology explaining symptom recurrence\n3. Guide surgical decision-making\n\nPLAN:\n1. Options discussed:\n   a. Repeat epidural injection\n   b. Repeat MRI to evaluate for interval change\n   c. Surgical consultation\n2. Patient prefers repeat MRI before deciding on next steps\n3. Requesting PA for repeat MRI lumbar spine\n4. Continue current medications\n5. Follow-up after imaging"
